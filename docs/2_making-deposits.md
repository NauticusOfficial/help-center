**IMPORTANT!** It is vital that you enter the *Unique Deposit Code* number as the *'description on recipient's statement' 'comment' or 'note'*. Your transfer will be delayed if you do not complete this step. The *Unique Deposit Code* changes each time. Please make sure you check this carefully.


**Please Note:** International bank transfers can take up to ten days to process. That's one reason they had to invent crypto.

*Payments from credit card accounts are not supported.*

*Third parties are not allowed to transfer funds to your account. Only send money from a bank account that is in your own name.*

**For more information please see the Terms and Conditions below.**



### 2.1.2 Sending from Australia


If you have an Australian Bank Account you will need to login to your own bank's website, or app, in order to transfer money into Nauticus Exchange. Each bank's interface is slightly different but they all offer similar functionality. 

If you've ever transferred money to a friend before, it is the exact same process.

On the Commonwealth Bank's NetBank for example you would follow these steps:
- Select Transfers and Bpay 
- Select the account from which you would like to transfer the funds
- Select New Payee.
- Enter the Account Name
- Enter the BSB
- Enter the Account Number
- Enter the amount you wish to transfer
- Enter the Unique Deposit Code



## 2.2 Deposit Crypto


The exact steps for depositing crypto assets will vary depending on which coin you are depositing and which wallet you are using. We recommend that you research the current best security practices when considering your choice of wallet and storage of your secret keys, passwords, "seed phrase" etc.


* To begin the deposit please go to the  **DEPOSITS**  page and select  **Cryptocurrency**  as shown below.
