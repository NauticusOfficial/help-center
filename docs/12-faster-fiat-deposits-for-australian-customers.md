![null](/docs/.vuepress/dist/nauticus-payid-v2.jpg)

Australian customers can now use the Pay ID / Osko system to transfer money into Nauticus Exchange.

The Pay ID / Osko system is the fastest way to get money into your Nauticus account.

The money will be credited to your account within 24 hours – seven days a week. That means you can now transfer money on a Saturday and it’ll appear in your Nauticus account on a Sunday.

The system will be refined further in future to enable even faster transfers.



## WHAT IS PAY ID / OSKO?



Osko is the new fast payments service that allows users to send and receive money almost instantly, at any time.

You simply need to sign up and register your own personal Pay ID with your bank – it can be your phone number, email address or even your ABN.

More than 60 Aussie banks – including ‘the Big 4’ – support the service.

It only takes a couple of minutes to set up and you’re ready to roll.



## HOW DO I USE PAYID / OSKO TO FUND MY NAUTICUS ACCOUNT?



Every bank does things slightly differently, so it’s worth reading up on how to use Pay ID with your bank’s website or app. There are links to further information below.



Log on to Nauticus Exchange and navigate to Australian dollar (AUD) deposits.



Enter the Nauticus Pay ID into your bank’s interface. At present you can choose either our email PayID or our phone number PayID.



The system will let you know that ‘NEX’ has registered that Pay ID.



In the comment/description field of you bank’s interface, ensure that you include the Unique Deposit Code generated by Nauticus.



Hit Pay or Send.



That’s it. Within 24 hours, the money will be credited to your account.

Note that as it’s still a fairly new system, it’s a little eccentric. For example, Westpac will only let you send money to phone number PayIDs, while Commonwealth Bank only lets you use PayID through its Android and iPhone App but not via its iPad App or the website.
