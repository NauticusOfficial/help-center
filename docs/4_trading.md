## Trade Types Available

### LIMIT

Use a LIMIT order when you would like to specify the price at which you would like to either Buy or Sell a given asset and the amounts that should be either bought or sold. The most obvious advantage here is the ability have an order execute at your desired price without the need to sit and monitor price activity.

When you set a LIMIT order your order will be placed into the queue to await for price action on the market to move to a price either equal to or better than the price you have specified, at which time the order will execute. 

Do keep in mind that only the number of units available to be either bought or sold at this price will execute sometimes resulting in a partially filled order.

Because a LIMIT order is visible to the market it may not be placed either *above the current market price* for a BUY order or *below the current market price* for a SELL order.  More will be discussed for why the ability to setup such orders may be useful sometimes and how to do this below under the  **STOP LIMIT**  topic.



### MARKET

Use a MARKET order when you would like your order to execute at the current market price for that asset. 

The most obvious advantage to this type of order is the ability to have your executed a the current market value without the need to wait on the price action to reach a certain level.

Do keep in mind that only the number of units available to be either bought or sold at this price will execute sometimes resulting in a partially filled order.



### STOP LIMIT

A STOP LIMIT order can be a useful part of your trading strategy if used properly. When the order is setup a STOP PRICE is specified which is the market price at which the LIMIT ORDER will activate.

These orders can be useful to prevent losses in a falling market by executing a SELL before the price has fallen too far. Another way to use such orders would be to ensure that a BUY is executed in a rising market before the price has climbed to far. 

The topic of STOP LIMIT orders is more advanced than the previously discussed order types and careful research should be conducted beforehand to ensure that you fully understand the concept of STOP LIMIT orders to ensure that you get the most out of these powerful tools.
