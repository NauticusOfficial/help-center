## Creating a new page

#### Create the page
* In order to add a page to existing documentation in the `/docs` folder, you need to create a new `Markdown` or `.md` page in a folder that already exists or by creating a new one.

#### Formate of the page
In order to be in compliance with `vuepress`, the tool, which we are currently using to create the documentation site,  your page needs to have minimum of this setup.

#### 	Deployment
After writing down your documentation and you are happy with it in development, you are now ready to deploy it to the live site.
These are the steps that you need to follow in order to have a successful deployment.
`Important` You can use Github's Desktop to deploy your changes without a hiccup.
