ICO Account Migration

Account Migration is ONLY for ICO participants and those with accounts on the Nauticus.io site.

To migrate your Nauticus.io account to the [Nauticus.Exchange](https://nauticus.exchange/) platform please take the following simple steps:

1. Sign in to your Nauticus.io account.
2. Click the large, red button that says “Account Migration.”

\3. You should then see a page that look like this while the system looks for an account matching your Nauticus.io-associated email address:

\4. If no account with a matching email address is found, it will ask you to create an account — please create an account with the same email address as you used for the Nauticus.io account to link the accounts.

If you have already created an account on the [Nauticus.exchange](https://nauticus.exchange/) (because you were an eager beaver and already went ahead and created one), please email us at support@nauticus.exchange and we will manually migrate the account for you.

\5. Creating a new exchange account will then progress you to the “Migration Complete” page.
