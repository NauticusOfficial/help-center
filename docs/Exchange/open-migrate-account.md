4 - If no account with a matching email address is found, it will ask you to create an account — please create an account with the same email address as you used for the Nauticus.io account to link the accounts.

In some cases you may have already created an account on the [Nauticus.exchange](https://nauticus.exchange/) , if this is the case then please email us at support@nauticus.exchange and we will manually migrate the account for you.
