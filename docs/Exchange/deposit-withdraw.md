# Making Deposits & Withdrawals



## Steps for Deposits




### Bank Deposit



If you have an Australian Bank Account you will need to login to your own bank's website, or app, in order to transfer money into Nauticus Exchange. Each bank's interface is slightly different but they all offer similar functionality. 

If you've ever transferred money to a friend before, it is the exact same process.

On the Commonwealth Bank's NetBank for example you would follow these steps:
- Select Transfers and Bpay 
- Select which account from which you would like to transfer the funds
- Select New Payee.
- Enter the Account Name: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
- Enter the BSB: xxxxxxxxxx
- Enter the Account Number: xxxxxxxxxx
- Enter the amount you wish to transfer: xxxxxxx
- Enter the Unique Deposit Code: xxxxxx

**IMPORTANT!** It is vital that you enter the Unique Deposit Code number as the 'description on recipient's statement' 'comment' or 'note'. Your transfer will be delayed if you do not complete this step. The Unique Deposit Code changes each time. Please make sure you check this carefully.



**Please Note:** Bank transfers in Australia can take 1-2 business days to complete. Transfers on weekends on public holidays will be delayed.

*Payments from credit card accounts are not supported.*

*Third parties are not allowed to transfer funds to your account. Only send money from a bank account that is in your own name.*
