# Making Deposits & Withdrawals



## Steps for Deposits




### Bank Deposit



If you have an Australian Bank Account you will need to login to your own bank's website, or app, in order to transfer money into Nauticus Exchange. Each bank's interface is slightly different but they all offer similar functionality. 

If you've ever transferred money to a friend before, it is the exact same process.

On the Commonwealth Bank's NetBank for example you would follow these steps:
- Select Transfers and Bpay 
- Select the account from which you would like to transfer the funds
- Select New Payee.
- Enter the Account Name
- Enter the BSB
- Enter the Account Number
- Enter the amount you wish to transfer
- Enter the Unique Deposit Code





**In the next example we will walk you through the steps for starting a deposit of USD.**



* Look to the menu in the upper right and select  **DEPOSITS**  as shown below.
