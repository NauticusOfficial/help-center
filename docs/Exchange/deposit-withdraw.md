# Making Deposits & Withdrawals



## Steps for Deposits

### BANK Deposit



If you have an Australian Bank Account you will need to login to your own bank's website, or app, in order to transfer money into Nauticus Exchange. Each bank's interface is slightly different but they all offer similar functionality. 

If you've ever transferred money to a friend before, it is the exact same process.

On the Commonwealth Bank's NetBank for example, you first select Transfers and Bpay, then select which account you want to transfer money from.

Select New Payee.

LTD
Enter the BSB: 112879

IMPORTANT! It is vital that you enter the Unique

Desposit Code number as the 'description on

recipient's statement' 'comment' or 'note'. You're

step. The deposit code changes each time. Please make

sure you check this carefully.

Please ensure the amount you transfer via your  is
