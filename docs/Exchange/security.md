# Securing Your Account



## 2FA & TOTP

The following section will explain the importance of securing your account with 2FA, and provides a quick setup guide to get your account configured with this vital layer of security.



### Why 2FA is Important

It is strongly recommended that all users set up 2FA as soon as possible to protect their accounts. A username and password is easily hacked resulting in the loss of your funds.

However by enabling 2FA a hacker would need access to your password AND your phone or device in order to log in to the exchange. It is also recommended that you separately use a fingerprint or facial lock for your device, or a passcode to add even more security layers.



### 2FA Quick Description 

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a form of 2-step verification used to add an additional layer of security to your account beyond the protection the username and password provides. 

Once 2FA is enabled on your account, at login you will first be prompted to provide your password (factor 1) and your 2FA code (factor 2) when signing in to your account. The 2FA codes are associated with something unique such as a specific device (mobile phone) or a phone number.



### TOTP Quick Description

Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) is the method of obtaining the 2FA login codes that Nauticus has elected to go with due to security concerns with the alternative "SMS" method. With TOTP you will run through the setup described below, then an algorithm will generate codes for you based on the current time and a "shared secret key" (more on this below).



### Setup 2FA

It is strongly recommended that all users set up 2FA as soon as possible to protect their accounts.

A username and password is easily hacked resulting in the loss of your funds.

However by enabling 2FA a hacker would need access to your password AND your phone or device in order to log in to the exchange. It is also recommended that you seperately use a fingerprint or facial lock for your device, or a passcode.

To enable 2FA first head to Google Play or the Apple Store and download either Google Authenticator, or as an alternative we would recommend Authy as having additional features which are quite useful.

**Google Authenticator**

[Download for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_AU)

[Download for Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8)

**Authy**

[Download for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en_AU)

[Download for Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8)

Login to Nauticus.exchange and click the hamburger menu at the top right, then 'settings', then the box marked 'security', then 'enable two factor'.

IMPORTANT: 2FA works by syncing up a randomly generated code using the time and date down to the second. This means your device should be set to 'network provided time' or else it won't work. Alternatively, you can go to the main menu of Google Authenticator, tap more: Settings. Tap 'Time Correction for Codes" and then tap 'Sync now'.

Open up Google Authenticator and press the + symbol. Tap 'Scan a barcode'. Point your camera at the QR Code until the device says 'secret saved'.

Make sure you save the long string of numbers on the screen and keep it somewhere safe (NOT ON YOUR DEVICE). It will help you to recover your account if you lose your device.

Type in the Nauticus code from the app to complete setup. Note that if you are too slow, the code will change and you'll need to enter the new code before it is replaced.
