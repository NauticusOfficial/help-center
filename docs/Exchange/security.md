# Securing Your Account



## 2FA & TOTP

The following section will explain the importance of securing your account with 2FA, and provides a quick setup guide to get your account configured with this vital layer of security.



### Why 2FA is Important

It is strongly recommended that all users set up 2FA as soon as possible to protect their accounts. A username and password is easily hacked resulting in the loss of your funds.

However by enabling 2FA a hacker would need access to your password AND your phone or device in order to log in to the exchange. It is also recommended that you separately use a fingerprint or facial lock for your device, or a passcode to add even more securately layers.



### 2FA Quick Description 

Two-factor authentication (2FA), also known as 2-step verification, is a security layer in addition to your username and password. With 2FA enabled on your account, you will have to provide your password (first “factor”) and your 2FA code (second “factor”) when signing in to your account. 2FA codes are associated with a specific device (such as your phone) or your phone number.
