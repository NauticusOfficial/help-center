# Securing Your Account



## 2FA

The following section will explain the importance of securing your account with 2FA, and provides a quick setup guide to get your account configured with this vital layer of security.



### Why 2FA is Important

It is strongly recommended that all users set up 2FA as soon as possible to protect their accounts. A username and password is easily hacked resulting in the loss of your funds.

However by enabling 2FA a hacker would need access to your password AND your phone or device in order to log in to the exchange. It is also recommended that you separately use a fingerprint or facial lock for your device, or a passcode to add even more securately layers.
