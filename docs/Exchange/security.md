# Securing Your Account



## 2FA & TOTP

The following section will explain the importance of securing your account with 2FA, and provides a quick setup guide to get your account configured with this vital layer of security.



### Why 2FA is Important

It is strongly recommended that all users set up 2FA as soon as possible to protect their accounts. A username and password is easily hacked resulting in the loss of your funds.

However by enabling 2FA a hacker would need access to your password AND your phone or device in order to log in to the exchange. It is also recommended that you separately use a fingerprint or facial lock for your device, or a passcode to add even more security layers.



### 2FA Quick Description 

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a form of 2-step verification used to add an additional layer of security to your account beyond the protection the username and password provides. 

Once 2FA is enabled on your account, at login you will first be prompted to provide your password (factor 1) and your 2FA code (factor 2) when signing in to your account. The 2FA codes are associated with something unique such as a specific device (mobile phone) or a phone number.



### TOTP Quick Description

Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) is the method of obtaining the 2FA login codes that Nauticus has elected to go with due to security concerns with the alternative "SMS" method. With TOTP you will run through the setup described below, then an algorithm will generate codes for you based on the current time and a "shared secret key" (more on this below)
