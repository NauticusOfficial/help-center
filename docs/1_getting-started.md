## Verifying Your Account

### Complete KYC

**_Step by step guide to completing KYC on Nauticus Exchange_**

Here’s what you need to do:

1. Sign into your account on a laptop or desktop PC and click on the Verify button. *(KYC is not yet enabled for mobile devices)*

   ![KYC01b](https://nauticus.exchange/help/images/Exchange/KYC01b.png)

2. Choose whether you want to be verified as an ‘Individual’ or as a  representative of a ‘Business’. If you select ‘Business’ you will need  to fill out a form and email it in. The rest of this guide only applies  if you select ‘Individual’.

**Note** Under Australian law a *“Sole Trader”* is an individual who runs a business (_‘trading’ in this sense does not refer to crypto trading_).  “Sole Traders” have an Australian Business Number and put aside tax to  pay at the end of each financial year. So if you aren’t Australian and  don’t have an ABN select ‘No’.

3. You’ll then land on this page. Please kindly fill out the information requested.

![KYC03](https://nauticus.exchange/help/images/Exchange/KYC03.png)

Notes:

* Fill in your Date of Birth in the Australian/UK format with the day first, and then the month.

* If you don’t live in an apartment or unit, you can leave the ‘Unit’ number blank.

* Fill in your **City** and where it says “City or Suburb” *(Suburb is an Australian address feature)*

* If  you have an unusual address that doesn’t quite fit with the structure  of this form, please ensure you write down all of the relevant parts of  your address somewhere within the form. Our staff can fix it later as  long as your entire address is there somewhere.


***Next up is a series of KYC/AML required questions. Please fill them out as accurately as you can.***

4. Next you will be asked about your employment status.

![KYC08](https://nauticus.exchange/help/images/Exchange/KYC08.png)

6. Next you land at the  following screen which asks you to choose  which ID type you wish to upload. If you have a Passport, select this  option as the success rate for our automated system is much higher than  with other ID types. 

![KYC10](https://nauticus.exchange/help/images/Exchange/KYC10.png)

Driver's License is the next best choice, with Government  issued ID cards in languages "other than English" to be selected as a last resort.

Be sure to read carefully through the success tips, then when you feel sure you are ready please tick the box at the bottom and click to continue.

18. Congratulations, you’ve almost made it through! Whew!

At this point you may wish to take a quick walk or make yourself a cup of tea.

**Please don’t try and log in to Nauticus again for five minutes while the system updates your verification status.**

**Even  better, don’t log back into your account until you have received an  email saying that you have been verified. An approval/rejection email  will be issued by the system, the minute you are approved (or rejected).**

If approved, congratulations, you are one step closer to trading on the Nauticus exchange!

And if you did not get verified for some reason, do not worry — we are here to help.

### Issues with KYC?

If you have experienced issues with your KYC verification, please navigate to the **Cases** section of your Account and copy the error code you find there.

Then please email us at <mailto:support@nauticus.exchange>  with the error code and any associated error messages, so that we can  help troubleshoot your KYC case and get you verified as soon as  possible.

**Note: after a failed KYC attempt, you will NOT be able to complete KYC without emailing Customer Support at** [**support@nauticus.exchange**](mailto:support@nauticus.exchange) **for troubleshooting first.**

Once, we have investigated and helped solve your issue, we will then re-enable your account to attempt KYC once again.
