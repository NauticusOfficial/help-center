Main Components


**Step 1.  Verifying the withdraw destination**

 

[Bank Verification Process](https://www.notion.so/02fa345a00cf438aa8ce18b703ce84f9)

All FIAT withdrawals must go to a bank account that is verified to be owned by the user who has the account.

1. "Withdrawals sent to unverified addresses will be denied, click ***here*** to verify your account."

2. [popup] "An email has been sent to you, with further instructions on verifying your account."

3. The email will be sent out with a reply-to address of "compliance@nauticus.exchange".

4. The email will contain instructions to reply to that email, attaching a bank statement and relevant verification info.

5. Once a reply has been received, a compliance officer will review the details and insert them into the admin dashboard - *currently in development, expected completion 16/11.*

6. **END**

 

**Step 2. Verifying withdraw requests.**


[Unverified FIAT Monitor](https://www.notion.so/e7f2e2b152d74761acffa1fec1699d4a)


There is no block on a user from submitting a withdraw request on any currency - apart from the disclaimer in step 1.

1. A user will be able to submit a FIAT withdraw request of any currency with any details - once they do this it goes into a queue of withdraw requests.

2. A monitor will be setup to scan all pending withdraws as a routine, and if the details are not found within the verified account details in step 1 - the transaction will be automatically marked as failed.

3. If the withdraw can be verified against the database of transactions, it will be ignored and processed accordingly.

4. **END**
