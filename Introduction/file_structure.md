## The Structure

The file structure is simple, each folder is like a webpage and however many `markdown`/`.md` files you create inside a folder, appears in the sidebar of that page. So far, all of our pages have been created inside the `Introduction` folder or the `/introduction` route, just look at the hyperlink of this page as an indicator.

The below screenshot will give you a reference to how this page was built how the folder is structured.
