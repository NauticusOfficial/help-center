## About Sidebar

The side bar is what you see on the left. Each page in the sidebar has it's own top level link.
If you look at the below screenshot, you can see that the `Create New Page` link has been opened and has been highlighted green.
You can also see that the `Create New Page` has sub-links. Those are created by inserting a sub-heading like this -> `## YOUR SUB-HEADING`.
You can add as many sub-headings as you want and they will keep adding up as links under the main heading link.
